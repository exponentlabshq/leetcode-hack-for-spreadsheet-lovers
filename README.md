# LeetCode for Spreadsheet Lovers 🧮

**Think of LeetCode as Excel formulas, but for programming interviews!**

If you're comfortable with spreadsheets and want to learn algorithmic problem-solving, this repository bridges that gap. We'll show you how LeetCode problems are just like building complex Excel formulas - but instead of `=SUM(A1:A10)`, you're writing code that does the same thing.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to think about algorithms like spreadsheet formulas
- Converting LeetCode problems into familiar CSV/table formats
- Understanding complexity (like knowing when your Excel sheet will be slow)
- Writing optimal solutions with mathematical proof

## 📊 Example: Running Sum Problem

### The Problem (Like a Spreadsheet Task)

**Question**: Given a list of numbers, create a new list where each number is the sum of all previous numbers plus itself.

**In Excel terms**: If you have `[1,2,3,4]` in cells A1:A4, you want B1:B4 to show `[1,3,6,10]` where:
- B1 = A1 (just the first number)
- B2 = A1 + A2 = 1 + 2 = 3
- B3 = A1 + A2 + A3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- B4 = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

### The Solution (Java Code)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
        // Step 1: Initialize (i=1) - nums[0] already correct as base case
        // Invariant: nums[0] = sum(original_nums[0..0])
        
        // Step 2-4: Iterate from i=1 to n-1 with in-place accumulation
        // Invariant maintained: ∀j<i: nums[j] = Σ(original_nums[0..j])
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Step 3: Accumulate - nums[i] = nums[i-1] + nums[i]
            // Necessity: Cannot skip this operation without breaking running sum property
            // Optimality: In-place update achieves O(1) auxiliary space
            nums[i] += nums[i-1];
            
            // Step 4: Increment handled by for loop
            // Ensures termination and progression through array
        }
        
        // Step 5: Return modified nums array
        // Post-condition: ∀i: nums[i] = Σ(original_nums[0..i])
        // Space optimal: Returns original array reference
        return nums;
    }
}
```

### How This Relates to Spreadsheets

| Step | What It Does | Excel Equivalent | Why It's Optimal |
|------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Keep first number as-is | `=A1` | Base case - no calculation needed |
| 2 | For each remaining cell... | Loop through A2:A4 | Must process each cell once |
| 3 | Add previous sum to current | `=B1+A2`, `=B2+A3`, etc. | Each cell depends on the one before |
| 4 | Store result in same position | Overwrite original data | Saves memory (like Excel's "in-place" calculation) |

### Complexity Analysis (Like Excel Performance)

- **Time**: O(n) - We visit each cell exactly once (like Excel calculating a formula)
- **Space**: O(1) - We don't create a new array (like Excel not needing extra columns)
- **Optimal**: This is the fastest possible solution - you can't do better!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the problem** like you'd read an Excel requirement
2. **Think in terms of formulas** - what calculation do you need?
3. **Consider efficiency** - like knowing when your Excel sheet will be slow
4. **Write the code** - like writing a complex Excel formula
5. **Verify correctness** - like checking your Excel calculations

## 💡 Key Insights for Spreadsheet Users

- **Arrays = Columns**: `nums[0], nums[1], nums[2]` is like `A1, A2, A3`
- **Loops = Fill Down**: `for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)` is like dragging a formula down
- **Variables = Cell References**: `nums[i-1]` is like referencing the cell above
- **Optimization = Efficient Formulas**: Just like avoiding `=SUM(A1:A1000)` when you could use `=A99+A1000`

## 🎓 Next Steps: How to Solve Any LeetCode Problem

### Step 1: Understand the Problem (Like Reading Excel Requirements)
1. **Read the problem statement** - What's the input? What's the expected output?
2. **Work through examples by hand** - Like testing a formula on sample data
3. **Identify the pattern** - What calculation or transformation is needed?

### Step 2: Think in Spreadsheet Terms
1. **Map the data structure**:
   - Arrays → Excel columns (A1, A2, A3...)
   - 2D arrays → Excel tables (A1:C3)
   - Strings → Text in cells
2. **Identify the operation**:
   - Summing → `=SUM()` function
   - Finding max/min → `=MAX()` or `=MIN()`
   - Counting → `=COUNTIF()`
   - Sorting → Excel's sort feature

### Step 3: Plan Your Algorithm (Like Designing a Formula)
1. **Break it into steps** - What would you do in Excel?
2. **Consider edge cases** - What if the data is empty? What if there's only one cell?
3. **Think about efficiency** - Will this be slow on large datasets?

### Step 4: Write the Code (Like Writing a Complex Formula)
1. **Start with the basic structure**:
   ```java
   // Like setting up your Excel columns
   for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       // Your calculation here
   }
   ```
2. **Handle edge cases first** - Like checking if your Excel range is empty
3. **Test with examples** - Like verifying your formula works on sample data

### Step 5: Optimize (Like Making Your Excel Sheet Faster)
1. **Check time complexity** - How many operations? (Like counting formula calculations)
2. **Check space complexity** - How much memory? (Like how many extra columns you need)
3. **Look for improvements** - Can you do this in fewer steps?

### Step 6: Practice Problems to Try Next
